== What's this? ==

th0th's Movie Collection is intended to be Wordpress plugin that enables you to share your movie collection. It is not anything yet, I've just started. You can check latest state of the project on experimental branch. I am not planning to wait until a fully-featured version is ready to release, I will release a stable version as soon as possible. And then I will move on adding one feature at a time :)

== Can I contribute? ==

Of course! You can share your feature requests, opinions or bug reports (i know there is nothing to debug yet, but you can check experimental branch for a non-functioning code if you are obsessed with finding bugs :P).

== Contact ==

You can contact me via e-mail (th0th -at- returnfalse.net).
